# Fridge Recipe

This project is a MERN requirement by code academy Bootcamp, built from scratch.

- [x] Mongo, Express, React, Node


I had the idea for this project to create a fridge recipe using Open ai, just filling out the input with ingredients by keywords.
The open Ai will create a recipe on base of those ingredients.
